Repository for High Lift Prediction Workshop Website.
The AIAA CFD High-Lift Prediction Workshop is a collaborative effort organized by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) to advance the state-of-the-art in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for high-lift aircraft configurations. These workshops focus on verification and validation of CFD methods for complex high-lift systems, such as transport aircraft with deployed flaps and slats during takeoff and landing conditions. Participants use standardized test cases, geometries, and committee-generated computational grids to assess the accuracy of various turbulence models, numerical schemes, and computational approaches in predicting the challenging flow physics associated with high-lift configurations. The workshops serve as important benchmarks for the CFD community, identifing strengths and limitations of current methods and helping to guide future research directions in high-lift aerodynamics prediction.
